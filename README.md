# Learning Katalon Studio

This project is about practicing the testing tool Katalon Studio (https://www.katalon.com/).

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to practice the features and usage of Katalon Studio. When creating the test cases, I focus on trying different features of Katalon studio.
As this is not a real project, efficiency and stability is not the purpose of the test design.

## Selenium Easy Website

The Selenium Easy website (https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test) was choosen for this project, because it offers the most common elements on average websites to practice with, like input fields, checkboxes, dropdown menus, etc.

## Manual test cases

As the aim of the project is only learning Katalon Studio, manual test cases haven't been implemented.

## Reports and logs

The first couple of reports and logs were pushed to this repository, so I can evaluate them in the future.
